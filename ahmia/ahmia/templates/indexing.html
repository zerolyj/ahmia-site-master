      <h2>Indexing and crawling</h2>
      <p>
        Ahmia is mainly divided into three parts.
        Codes for these parts are open source and available on Github.
        You can click on respective links to access them.
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="//github.com/ahmia/ahmia-index">Index</a>:
          It refers to the data that Ahmia has collected. We use
          <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">
          Elascticsearch</a> to maintain this data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="//github.com/ahmia/ahmia-crawler">Crawler</a>:
          It is the part that crawls onions on the Tor network and feed it to
          the index. <a href="https://scrapy.org/"> Scrapy </a>
          is one of the crawlers that we use.
        </li>
        <li><a href="//github.com/ahmia/ahmia-site">Site</a>: It is the
          backbone of Ahmia that includes the design of the website and makes
          the search engine work.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Ahmia collects a list of known .onion sites, information about these
        sites and saves it to its database. Collected data is filtered to
        remove child abuse content (Refer:
        <a href="{% url 'blacklist' %}"> {% trans "Blacklist" %} </a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Once data is filtered, it is available for search at Ahmia.

      <h2>Robots.txt</h2>

      <p>
        We are honouring robots.txt files. This means that you can prevent our
        crawler from indexing your page by using robots.txt rules. This way your
        page is not shown in the search results. On the other hand, your page
        still shows in the list of all known hidden services that are online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check <a href="//www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">robotstxt.org</a>
        for details to create robots.txt.
